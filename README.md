# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe — Python Console Game

A clean, fully playable **Tic-Tac-Toe (Noughts and Crosses)** game implemented in Python.  
Designed to practice **Python fundamentals**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and basic **game logic**.

---

## 📌 About The Project

This repository implements a **console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game** where two players take turns marking the board.  

Key objectives:
- Learn Python OOP concepts
- Understand game flow and logic
- Practice input handling and validation
- Keep code clean, readable, and extendable

The project is beginner-friendly but can be extended to include **AI opponents, GUI interfaces, or online multiplayer**.

## 🧠 Features

- Two-player local gameplay
- Display board in console
- Automatic detection of win, draw, or invalid moves
- Input validation for player moves
- Maintainable and readable Python code

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- Python 3
- Console-based interface
- Optional future GUI: Pygame or Tkinter

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hasti-espahlar86/tic-tac-toe.git
```

### Run the game

```bash
cd tic-tac-toe
python tic-tac-toe.py
```

Follow the instructions in the console to play.

## 💡 How to Play

1. The board positions are numbered **1 to 9**:

```
1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
7 | 8 | 9
```

2. Player X always goes first.  
3. Players take turns entering the number corresponding to the board position.  
4. The game automatically checks for **win**, **draw**, or **invalid moves**.  
5. The first player to align **three marks in a row, column, or diagonal** wins.

---

## 💻 Example Gameplay

```
Player X turn. Enter position (1-9): 1
Player O turn. Enter position (1-9): 5
Player X turn. Enter position (1-9): 2
Player O turn. Enter position (1-9): 3
Player X turn. Enter position (1-9): 9
Player X wins! 🎉
```

*This demonstrates a typical turn-by-turn session in the console.*

## 🚧 Current Limitations

- Only two-player local mode (no AI yet)  
- Console-based interface only  
- Limited input validation (basic error handling)  
- No automated tests

---

## 🧭 Future Improvements

- Add AI opponent using **Minimax algorithm**  
- Implement a GUI with **Pygame** or **Tkinter**  
- Add online multiplayer support  
- Include **unit tests** for all game functions  
- Modularize code for easier extension

## 📖 Project Purpose

This repository is for **learning and practice**, emphasizing:

- Writing **clean, maintainable code**  
- Understanding **game logic**  
- Practicing **Python fundamentals and OOP**  

It is perfect for beginners looking to create a fun, playable game while learning solid programming practices.
